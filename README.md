# **Hi, I'm Jennifer ✨**

I build **data products, metric systems, and analytics foundations** that help growing companies make clear, confident decisions without over-engineering.
Most of my work sits at the intersection of **data modeling, BI architecture, metric standardization, workflow optimization, and analytics product strategy**.

I focus on **real-world clarity**: clean data pipelines, trustworthy dashboards, usable semantic layers, and business logic that teams actually understand. I love taking scattered systems and turning them into simple and reliable sources of truth. I regularly use AI tools to accelerate analysis, documentation, and exploration while keeping the underlying data logic explicit, auditable, and human-readable

## **🛠️ What I Work On**

### **Analytics & Data Modeling**

* Business-friendly data models (Sales, Marketing, Product, Ops)
* Metric standardization + KPI dictionaries
* Semantic layers for BI tools (Sigma, Looker, Metabase, Mode)
* Data transformations using SQL, dbt-like patterns, and warehouse modeling
* Designing stable data schemas and definitions that scale

### **Data Foundations & Quality**

* Analytics foundations for startups (Snowflake, BigQuery, SQLite, Azure SQL)
* Data quality checks: freshness, anomalies, mismatches
* Lightweight pipelines and automations for reporting
* Improving trust in dashboards through validation + lineage clarity

### **Operational Analytics**

* End-to-end funnel builds for Marketing + Sales
* Product analytics instrumentation + Mixpanel setup

### **Storytelling & Decision Systems**

* Executive KPI command centers
* Monthly insights and dashboard narratives
* Dashboard UX + self-serve analytics enablement
* Documentation hubs for metric and data knowledge

# **ℹ️ About Me**

I’ve led data foundation work across complex teams spanning sales funnels, marketing pipelines, product analytics, and BI migrations.

I love working where **data, product, and clarity meet**:
building trustworthy systems, simplifying complexity, aligning definitions, and designing insights that actually drive decisions.

My background spans analytics engineering, product management, data strategy, BI architecture, and metric governance. I also consult with nonprofits and early-stage teams who want to build clean analytics foundations without hiring full data teams.
